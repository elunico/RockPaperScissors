# RockPaperScissors
BadRockPaperScissors

I have been attempting to understand Interface Builder and Swift and suffice it to say, it's been an ordeal

This is all I have so far, it is basically a random rock, paper, scissor game

You can see the same game implemented with Tkinter and a little bit of AI in the Python repository.
